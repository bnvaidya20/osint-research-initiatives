# Leveraging the OSINT Framework to Build Strategic International Research Partnerships

[Back](../README.md)

## Introduction

As a Principal Investigator (PI) at a Canadian university leading projects in emerging technologies‚Äîsuch as Artificial Intelligence, Quantum Computing, Digital Twins, and Sustainable Systems‚Äîidentifying reliable and high-impact international collaborators is essential for extending research impact, securing global funding, and advancing Canada's scientific diplomacy. According to Canada's Science, Technology, and Innovation Strategy (2023), fostering international partnerships is critical to national competitiveness. This guide outlines how to leverage the **OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) Framework** to systematically identify, validate, and engage with international research institutions, with a special focus on **South Asia and Southeast Asia**.

## Why OSINT for Academic Collaboration?

The OSINT Framework provides a curated ecosystem of open-source tools that can extract structured intelligence from publicly available data. In academic contexts, it supports:

- **Discovering emerging institutions and researchers** aligned with strategic focus areas.
- **Analyzing co-publication and co-funding networks** to assess collaboration history.
- **Mapping regional technology trends and institutional readiness**.
- **Validating digital presence and research credentials**.
- **Uncovering untapped funding or partnership opportunities**.
- **Conducting lightweight, compliant partner screening**.

> üîç All data should be triangulated with official sources to ensure accuracy and ethical compliance.

## Real-World Scenario: Scouting Collaborators in Quantum Communication

Imagine preparing a tri-country research grant (e.g., **NSERC Alliance International + EU Horizon + ASEAN science fund**) in **Quantum Communication Networks**. You need to find a research-intensive university in Southeast Asia that:

- Publishes actively in quantum technology.
- Demonstrates a track record in international collaborations.
- Has access to emerging infrastructure like quantum simulators or satellite links.
- Is compliant and reputation-safe, without ethical, legal, or governance red flags.

## Step-by-Step Procedure to Use the OSINT Framework

### Step 1: Define Strategic Requirements

Establish your criteria:

- **Technological Scope**: Quantum key distribution, quantum repeaters.
- **Geographic Focus**: ASEAN countries (Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Vietnam).
- **Collaboration Mode**: Co-authorship, co-supervision, joint degrees.
- **Risk Parameters**: Compliance, data governance, eligibility for Canadian and international grants.

  `Domain Research ‚Üí WHOIS Lookup | BuiltWith`

Evaluate:
- Domain age, ownership, DNS stability.
- Use of modern web technologies (e.g., preprint servers, cloud platforms).

#### B. Monitor Announcements & Web Signals

**Tools**: Google Alerts, Talkwalker, RSS Feeds

Track phrases like:
- ‚ÄúQuantum Research Collaboration MoU‚Äù
- ‚ÄúSoutheast Asia Quantum Conference‚Äù
- ‚ÄúCanada-Singapore joint initiative‚Äù
